## Hello 👋🏿 

My name is Candace. Soon, you'll see a few blog posts related to backend development, data engineering, and machine learning. For now, you can check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/teacherc/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/williams-candace/).

### Public Projects:
[Spheri](http://spheri.app) is a web app that gives users Spotify song recommendations based on their local weather conditions. The app received [500+ upvotes in r/Python](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/zb6ro9/i_got_laid_off_in_midoctober_and_decided_to_teach/) and has [Github contributors](https://github.com/teacherc/spheri-app).
